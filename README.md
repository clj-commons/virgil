Do you tarnish your Clojure with the occasional hint of Java?  Have you become indescribably tired of reloading your REPL every time you change anything with a `.java` suffix?  Look no further.

Virgil is a library for live-recompiling Java classes from the REPL. This can be
done either manually or by starting a process that watches your source
directories for changes in Java files and triggering recompilation when that
happens.

### Usage

Add `com.clojure-goes-fast/virgil` dependency to your `project.clj` or
`deps.edn`. Since this is a devtime dependency, you probably want to a
profile/alias that you enable only during development.

[![](https://clojars.org/com.clojure-goes-fast/virgil/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.clojure-goes-fast/virgil)

```clj
(require 'virgil)
;; To recompile once, manually:
(virgil/compile-java ["src"])

;; To recompile automatically when files change:
(virgil/watch-and-recompile ["src"])
```

The main argument to these functions is a list of directories where Java source
files are located. Both functions can accept a list of string `:options` that is
passed to Java compiler, e.g. `:options ["-Xlint:all"]` to print compilation
warnings, and a `:verbose` flag to print all classnames that got compiled.

`watch-and-recompile` accepts an optional `:post-hook` function. You can use it
to, e.g., trigger `tools.namespace` refresh after the classes get recompiled.

Check [examples](examples) directory for sample projects.

Happy tarnishing.

### Supported versions

Virgil makes sure to support Clojure 1.10+ and JDK 8, 11, 17, 20 (see [CI
job](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/clojure-goes-fast/virgil).
Supporting future versions of Java so far required only bumping ASM library
dependency, so that shouldn't take long. Please, create an issue if you run into
any compatibility problems.
